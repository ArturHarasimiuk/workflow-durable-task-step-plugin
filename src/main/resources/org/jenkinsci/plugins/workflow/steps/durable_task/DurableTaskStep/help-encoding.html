    Encoding of process output.
    In the case of <code>returnStdout</code>, applies to the return value of this step;
    otherwise, or always for standard error, controls how text is copied to the build log.
    If unspecified, uses the system default encoding of the node on which the step is run,
    but if there is any expectation that process output might include non-ASCII characters,
    it is best to specify the encoding explicitly.
